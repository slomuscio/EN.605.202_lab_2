# Summary 
Code to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem both recursively and iteratively using Lists with Python version 3.10.9.


# Usage
To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with the number of disks held in input_output/input.txt, the user must run the driver.py script. 
This driver script will read the input cases from the input file, then determine the steps necessary to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem recursively then iteratively. 
This script will write these steps along with timing metrics to an output text file input_output/output.txt. 
If an error is encountered, the error is written to the output file. 


# How to Run   
1. EDITOR   
   Open the lab_2 directory in VSCode editor (or editor of choice).   
   Open driver.py and run the file.    

2. COMMAND LINE    
   cd to repo root directory   
   Run command: python driver.py    


# File/Directory Descriptions 
input_output/   
    - input.txt: Text file that contains various input cases (representing numbers of disks), including cases that will throw errors. One input per line.
    - output_example.txt: Example output text file that I generated by running driver.py. When user runs driver.py, the script will generate output.txt that will be saved in this directory. 
    - output.txt: Not initially included in this directory. This file will be generated once the user runs driver.py. Each time user runs driver.py, this file will be overwritten. 

src.py 
    - Contains source code functions for Tower of Hanoi recursive algorithm solution and iterative algorithm solution. 
    - Contains wrapper function that runs both recursive and iterative algorithms within one function call and properly the formats output of each. 
    - Handles errors. 

driver.py
    - Contains main driver function that reads number of disks, runs recursive and iterative solutions, and writes recursive, iterative, and error outputs to input_output/output.text
